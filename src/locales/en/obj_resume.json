    "description": "My path in software development began in 2008, during my technical course. In 2010, I completed the program and started my first programming internship — I have been working and growing in the field ever since. Hired as a software engineer that same year, I have worked on more than 90 projects, using languages such as PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Python and other languages and libraries. I am currently a senior software engineer at <b><a href='https://iguatemi.com.br/' target='_blank'>Iguatemi S.A</a></b>. <br /> Driven by a passion for technology and a commitment to continuous improvement, I completed a degree in Information Technology Management, a postgraduate specialisation in Strategic IT Planning, and began a Master's in Computer Science, which I did not complete for personal reasons. In light of advances in technology and artificial intelligence, I began a postgraduate degree in AI and automation, to stay aligned with market demands and continue growing in my career."

The Eboracum simulator was developed and extended mainly in Java.
